title: Secure Tauri/Windows Code Signing with Certum HSM 
subtitle: One of our products — Defguard & WireGuard Desktop Client has multiple platform releases (Linux, MacOS, and Windows). We're building it with our beloved Rust and a great multi-platform desktop framework Tauri.

[Defguard & WireGuard desktop client](https://defguard.net/client/)

While doing releases with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is pretty straightforward and well-documented, the [Code Signing for MacOS is](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/sign-macos) spot-on, but the [Windows Code Signing](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/sign-windows) is not that straightforward. Tauri documentation assumes you have a certificate file (pfx - with certificate & key) - but **most
 (if not all) Code Signing Certificates are sold on dedicated HSMs 
(Hardware Security Modules) that must be FIPS 140-2 compliant.**

Thus to handle signing:

1. One has to have a **self-hosted GitLab/Github Runner** - which just physically can have the HSM connected to the USB (and of 
  course the runner needs to be in a secure network location and well as 
  the system needs to be secured).
2. There needs to be a solution & tools to handle this process automatically during the build & release.

Most certificate authorities have a dedicated solution for that ([DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/solutions/security-solutions-for-ci-cd), [Sectigo](https://www.sectigo.com/enterprise-solutions/certificate-manager/devops-solutions)) or solutions, examples, and a great documentation ([SSL.com](https://www.ssl.com/guide/code-signing-automation/)) but we have chosen [Certum Code Signing](https://www.certum.eu/en/code-signing-certificates/) certificate for two reasons, they operate as us in Szczecin Poland 💪 and they have a great [Open Source Code Signing](https://shop.certum.eu/open-source-code-signing.html) product - and [defguard](http://github.com/defGuard/defguard) is an open-source project. The downside is that **they do not have any CI/CD documentation or solutions**,
 and weirdly (everything should be on the internet 😀, yes?) there are 
no docs, solutions, snippets, projects, or blogs (you name it), that 
could help us set up this process.

So after weeks of going back 
and forward with the Certum support and going nowhere (greeting for our 
colleagues 👋), we took this project on our shoulders - and here are the
 recipes for building a Debian GNU/Linux CI/CD runner.

We assume you have:

1. a configured GitHub/GitLab self-hosted runner based on Debian GNU/Linux (but Ubuntu should work as well)
2. Bought an [Open Source Code Signing Certificate set from Certum](https://shop.certum.eu/open-source-code-signing.html)
3. Have the certificate issued and the key is on the HSM shipped by Certum and it's connected to the runner.
4. You
  also have downloaded the certificate file in PEM format (from certum 
  website), and placed it in /srv/codesign/certum/certificate.pem

Now we need to prepare the runner system to support the HSM. First let's install all necessary system software:

```bash
apt install opensc opensc-pkcs11 libpcsclite-dev pcscd libacsccid1 \
            libengine-pkcs11-openssl osslsigncode
```

Now, we need to install the Linux version of [proCertumCardManager](https://support.certum.eu/en/cert-offer-card-manager/) provided by Certum:

```bash
mkdir /srv/codesign/
cd /srv/codesign/

# pobieramy proCertumCardManager
wget https://www.files.certum.eu/software/proCertumCardManager/Linux-Ubuntu/2.2.11/proCertumCardManager-2.2.11-x86_64-ubuntu.bin

# We do not install the software, just extract it
/srv/codesign/proCertumCardManager-2.2.11-x86_64-ubuntu.bin --keep
mv dist certum

# create links, if you would like to actually use the
# Certum Card Manager software

ln -s /srv/codesign/certum/cryptoCertum3PKCS-3.0.6.69-MS.so /usr/lib/libcrypto3PKCS.so
ln -s /srv/codesign/certum/cryptoCertum3PKCS-3.0.6.69-MS.so /usr/lib/libcryptoCertum3PKCS.so
```

Now, we can check if the system sees the HSM and can show us the certificate & key details:

```bash
$ pkcs11-tool --module /srv/codesign/certum/sc30pkcs11-3.0.6.68-MS.so --login --list-objects

Using slot 0 with a present token (0x1)
Logging in to "profil standardowy".

# here you need to provide the PIN to access the card/HSM

Please enter User PIN:

# After providing the PIN, you should see the contents of the card

```

! As you can see, the key ID (this is important) is: 352c322687efb09df068a792c49cbac631d40cf0

Now
 the final, let's check if the code signing works - for that we have a 
defguard.exe unsigned binary, which we will sign and check if it works:

```bash
$ osslsigncode sign \
  -pkcs11module /srv/codesign/certum/sc30pkcs11-3.0.6.68-MS.so \
  -certs /srv/codesign/certificate.pem \
  -key 352c322687efb09df068a792c49cbac631d40cf0 \
  -pass <PIN> \
  -h sha256 \
  -t http://time.certum.pl/ \
  -in defguard.exe \
  -out defguard-signed.exe


# You should see the following message and result:

Engine "pkcs11" set.
Succeeded
```

And checking the signature:

```bash
$ osslsigncode verify defguard-signed.exe

# And so on...

Now what is left for you to do, is add the osslsigncode sign to your pipeline, and don't forget to make the **PIN a secret.**
